# Research

MINE Lab is dedicated to advancing cutting-edge artificial intelligence technologies, focusing on three main areas: 1) building socially impactful and trustworthy foundation models, 2) exploring AI for Science (particularly in chemistry and social science), and 3) leveraging graph-based learning to solve real-world problems. Our work bridges theoretical innovation and practical applications across diverse domains.

### Socially Impactful and Trustworthy Foundation Models

We are deeply invested in developing **foundation models** that combine state-of-the-art performance with societal responsibility. As foundational models become central to AI innovation, we aim to ensure that these powerful tools are not only efficient but also trustworthy, transparent, and accountable. We design models that can drive progress in critical areas like medicine, healthcare, education, and more.

### AI for Science

In the domain of **AI for Science**, our lab explores the intersection of artificial intelligence with chemistry and social science. We aim to apply AI models (e.g., generative models) to accelerate advancements in molecular design, reaction prediction, and material discovery. Recently, we have extended our focus to the application of these techs in social sciences. Using large-scale social data and model-based simulation, we aim to uncover patterns in individual behavior, social norms, and public policy impacts. By blending machine learning with social science theories, we provide data-driven insights for decision-making, enabling solutions to socioeconomic challenges and enhancing the effectiveness of public governance.

### Graph-Based Learning for Real-World Problem Solving

Graph-based learning is a cornerstone of our lab's efforts to address complex real-world challenges. Many real-world problems, such as social networks, recommendation systems, or molecular structures, can be represented as graphs. Our research applies graph-based methods to tasks like drug discovery, recommendation system, and knowledge graph construction, leveraging the structure of graph data to uncover patterns and improve decision-making across diverse domains.
