- title: "The Best of Both Worlds: Toward an Honest and Helpful Large Language Model"
  image: honest_architecture.png
  description: "The study refines principles for honest LLMs and identifies six scenarios requiring honesty. It introduces HONESET, a dataset of 930 queries, to evaluate LLM honesty. Two approaches are proposed to improve honesty and helpfulness: (1) Curiosity-Driven Prompting, a training-free method that encourages LLMs to express uncertainty and optimize responses; and (2) a two-stage fine-tuning approach, inspired by curriculum learning, to enhance LLM performance in these aspects."

  description: Drawing inspiration from adversarial training in deep learning and LLM agent learning processes, we introduce the In-Context Adversarial Game (ICAG) for defending against jailbreaks without the need for fine-tuning. ICAG leverages agent learning to conduct an adversarial game, aiming to dynamically extend knowledge to defend against jailbreaks.

  description: This paper introduces TrustLLM, a comprehensive study of trustworthiness in LLMs, including principles for different dimensions of trustworthiness, established benchmark, evaluation, and analysis of trustworthiness for mainstream LLMs, and discussion of open challenges and future directions. Specifically, we first propose a set of principles for trustworthy LLMs that span eight different dimensions. Based on these principles, we further establish a benchmark across six dimensions including truthfulness, safety, fairness, robustness, privacy, and machine ethics. We then present a study evaluating 16 mainstream LLMs in TrustLLM, consisting of over 30 datasets.
