- title: "HonestLLM: Toward an Honest and Helpful Large Language Model"
  image: honest_architecture.png
  description: "The study refines principles for honest LLMs and identifies six scenarios requiring honesty. It introduces HONESET, a dataset of 930 queries, to evaluate LLM honesty. Two approaches are proposed to improve honesty and helpfulness: (1) Curiosity-Driven Prompting, a training-free method that encourages LLMs to express uncertainty and optimize responses; and (2) a two-stage fine-tuning approach, inspired by curriculum learning, to enhance LLM performance in these aspects."

- title: "Defending Jailbreak Prompts via In-Context Adversarial Game"
  image: ICAG.png
  description: Drawing inspiration from adversarial training in deep learning and LLM agent learning processes, we introduce the In-Context Adversarial Game (ICAG) for defending against jailbreaks without the need for fine-tuning. ICAG leverages agent learning to conduct an adversarial game, aiming to dynamically extend knowledge to defend against jailbreaks.
